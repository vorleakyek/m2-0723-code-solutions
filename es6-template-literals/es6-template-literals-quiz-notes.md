## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the syntax for writing a template literal?
  In ES6, we can create a template literal by wrapping the text in backticks (`) as follows:

let simple = `This is a template literal`;

- What is "string interpolation"?

String interpolation is a feature that allows us to inject variables, function calls, and arithmetic expressions directly into a string by using the template literal.

const bio = `My name is ${firstName} ${lastName} and I am ${age} years old.`;

Notes from reading:
The substitutions allow you to embed variables and expressions in a string. The JavaScript engine will automatically replace these variables and expressions with their values. This feature is known as string interpolation.
